# Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Program Description
This [program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) will prepare you for a data science career. Learn to use Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions.

## Projects
1. [Investigate a Dataset](./investigate_dataset)  
Use Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it.

2. [Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](./wrangle_data)  
Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.

3. [Explore and Summarize Data](./explore_data)  
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

4. [Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](./stroop_test)  
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the [Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect), a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

5. [Identify Fraud from Enron Email](./project_enron)  
Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

6. [Create a Tableau Story](./data_viz)  
Use Tableau to create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
